# Stata-Regression-Teaching-Exercise
Teaching exercise for stata with summary statistics, graphing, logistic regression and exporting results tables.

This exercise walks students through replicating the results in the paper by Anderson et al. I have created a basic dataset that has done all the data cleaning from the raw household survey data, that they use then to build the specific analysis variables and run the regressions to compare results with the published paper. The students use logistic regression whereas the paper used ordinal logistic regression and the exercise walks them through contemplating the difference in the methods and comparing the (concurring) results. The .do file of the exercise is the teaching tool and contains editorial text to guide their learning through each step. I could be taught in person or given as an exercise with the .do file provided as the answer key afterwards.
